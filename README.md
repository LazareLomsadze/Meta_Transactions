# GasLess_Token

The GaslessTokenTransfer and ERC20Permit contracts work together harmoniously to empower users with gasless token transfer capabilities.
The ERC20Permit contract provides a modern and gas-efficient implementation of ERC20,
while the GaslessTokenTransfer contract allows users to execute token transfers without worrying about gas fees, thanks to the permit function.
